    <h1> This Website</h1>
    <p>
        Having never used html or css before, making this website helped me learn the
        basics of these languages. Also, all of the code for every one of my projects
        can be found on my GitHub.

    <h1>Rocket</h1>
    <p>
        A quickly made 2D Java game made mostly during the lectures of my Intro to Computer Science class.
        You control a rocket that can move up or down to avoid many types of incoming attackers 
        with the goal being to complete all 36 waves to secure victory.
