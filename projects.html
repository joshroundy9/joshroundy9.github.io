    <h1> This Website</h1>
    <p>
        Having never used HTML or CSS before, making this website helped me learn the

    <h1>Rocket</h1>
    <p>
        A quickly constructed 2D Java game made mostly during the lectures of my Intro to Computer Science class.
        The player controls a rocket that can move up or down to avoid many types of incoming attackers 
        with the goal being to complete all 36 waves to secure victory.
