        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <h2>Beginnings</h2>
        <p>
            I first started software development at the early age 
            of 11 as I, like many other kids my age, was obsessed with Minecraft.
            This obsession led me to want to start my own Minecraft server like many
            of my favorite youtubers had done themselves, but to truely stand out from 
            the other servers you had to have custom coded plug ins. So I started watching
            tutorial videos on how to code with Java and how to use the required APIs which
            quickly led to my infatuation with software development.

            Where I Am Today
        </h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            After programming Minecraft plugins for 18 months straight I took an extended break
            from coding as I had temporarilly found other hobbies such as hiking,
            lifting, and sports. Come my Senior year of high school I rediscovered 
            software development and decided to make it my major in college due to
            my prior knowledge and the incredible career opportunities it provides.
